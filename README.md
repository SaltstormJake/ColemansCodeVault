This is a record of the "code vault" Dr. Rick Coleman, a retired Computer Science professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, maintained on his personal website, giving examples of various data structure and design pattern implementations to assist the university's CS students. Due to his retirement and the site being hosted on a university URL, the eventual shutdown of his site is a possibility, so I have decided to preserve his code snippets here. With the exception of a few syntax fixes, none of the work here is my own.
